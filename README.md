### Graphical Abstract 
![image](https://github.com/EllaCCT/EllaCCT/blob/main/snake%20game%20demo.PNG) snake game demo.PNG
### Purpose of the software includes
Which type of software development process is applied. 
Agile 

Why you choses this type (Waterfall vs. Agile)? 
Agile methods were chosen for the software development process. This choice was made for flexibility, continuous improvement, and rapid iteration. Agile allows for regular feedback and adaptation, which is essential to enhance the user expericence and respond effectively to changing market demands.

### Possible usage of your software (i.e., target market) 
We want to publish in websites and the WeChat minis programs

### Software development plan 
### Development Process 

1.Create an object 

2.Create a user interface 

3.Search the graphic, sound, metarial 

4.Write the move function 

5.Write the logical function 

6.Testing and adjusting the programming

### Schedule
Week1: planning the snake game structure, for example, how the snake moves, how the snake eats, the levels for the games, the score... 

Week2: writing the code with the snake game in the replit, using the algorithms to define the snake game scores, the user interface and conduct initial testing. 

Week3: Testing our game and finding the error, to reflect in our developer and collect the feedback. 

### Algorithm
Snake games use algorithms for snake movement, food placement, collision detection, and scoring mechanisms.

### Current status of your software 
We are now in the Week3, testing our game with the snake score, snake collision. 

### Future plan
Completing the remaining sprints, conducting extensive testing, collecting user feedback, and making necessary adjustments based on that feedback. After thorough testing and refinement, the software will be released to target markets on a variety of platforms, including mobile devices and desktops.
